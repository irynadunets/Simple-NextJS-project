### GET route on /api/greetings with a first_name parameter that returns a simple "Hello ${first_name}!" in the payload key of a JSON object.

### POST route on /api/create_user that takes a JSON object with a firstName and a lastName keys and returns those keys and the values fully capitalized into the payload key of a JSON object. Your API needs to return usable errors for everything that could go wrong (missing parameters, not found route, wrong method...)
